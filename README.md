# macWindow
Puts your image in mac's window

Max image size is 1750 and I'm too lazy to make changes in hardcoded sizes

Remember to put your helvetica.ttf font path

For python3+, requires pillow

```
open cmd
pip install pillow
close cmd
```

The main file is macWindow.py, more details inside the docstring of drawMacWindow function

I've made the mistake of hardcoding sizes and positions, if you got spare time feel free to make them resizable according to the maxImgSize
